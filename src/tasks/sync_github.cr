      # https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#about-the-search-api
      #
      # However, there's a neat trick we could use to fetch more than 1000 results when executing a repository search.
      # We will split up our search into segments, by the date when the repositories were created.
      #
      # For example, we could first search for repositories that were created in October 2019, then September 2019, and so on.
      # Because we would be restricting search to a narrow period, we will probably get less than 1000 results,
      # and would therefore be able to get all of them.
      # In case we notice that more than 1000 results are returned for a period, we would have to narrow the period even more,
      # so that we can collect all results.
